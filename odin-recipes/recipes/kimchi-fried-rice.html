        <h2>Warm, bright & comforting</h2>
        <p>This recipe is a perfect way to use up any leftover kimchi, or an excellent excuse to open up another jar. </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 oz cremini mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 carrot</li>
            <li>1 bunch baby bok choy</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1" piece of ginger</li>
            <li>1 scallion</li>
            <li>1/2 cup kimchi</li>
            <li>8 oz cooked rice</li>
            <li>2 TBSP vegetable oil, separated</li>
            <li>Creamy Japanese Togarashi Sauce for serving</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prep the vegetables. Slice the carrot, chop the bok choy into 2" pieces, thinly slice the scallion, 
                slice the mushrooms, mince garlic and ginger, roughly chop the kimchi.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 TBSP vegetable oil in a large skillet. Once the oil is hot, add the mushrooms. Brown the mushrooms, only turning over once, until slightly crispy on both sides. 
                Add the carrots, bok choy, garlic and ginger to the hot pan. Cook until crisp-tender. Salt and pepper to taste. Transfer vegetables to a plate.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining 1 TBSP vegetable oil to the pan on med-high heat. When hot, add rice. Once rice begins to brown and crisp in places, add vegetables 
                back to the pan with the rice. Also add the chopped kimchi, stir until all is hot.</li>
            <li>Serve the kimchi fried rice in bowls or plates with a drizzle of creamy Japanese Togarashi sauce and a sprinkling of sliced scallions.</li>
        </ol>
