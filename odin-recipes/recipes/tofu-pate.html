        <h1>Tofu Pat&eacute;</h1>
        <img src="../recipe-images/tofu-pate.jpg" alt="An image of tofu pat&eacute; and a couple slices of bread.">
        <h2> Creamy, dreamy & oh so easy</h2>
        <p>Call it a pat&eacute;, dip or spread. This stuff is fanastic as a base in sandwiches piled high with crunchy veggies 
            or as a creamy, slightly zippy dip for chips, crackers or crudites. And bonus, it is also quick to prepare!</p>

        <h2> Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 package (14oz) of extra firm tofu</li>
            <li>2 ribs of celery</li>
            <li>1/2 of a medium white, yellow or sweet onion</li>
            <li>2/3 cup mayo</li>
            <li>1 TBS dried parsley</li>
            <li>2 tsp powdered mustard</li>
            <li>2 tsp nutritional yeast</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp tumeric</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2> Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Press the tofu in advance or if you're in a rush, while you prepare the rest of the recipe.</li>
            <li>Finely chop the celery and onion.</li>
            <li>In a good size mixing bowl, stir all the seasonings into the mayo. Then mix in your minced vegetables.</li>
            <li>Crumble the tofu into the mixing bowl and stir everything together well. If you like this texture, you can be done here. 
                If you want a smoother texture, throw it into a food processor until you reach the creamier texture you desire. Personally, 
                I like to throw half of the spread into the food processor and then stir the creamier version into the chunkier version for 
                the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li>Let your pretty pat&eacute; rest in the fridge for at least an hour to let the flavors meld. Stir again when ready to serve.</li>
        </ol>
