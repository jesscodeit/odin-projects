        <p>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy or as it's simply known, the Guide. This will help you navigate your 
            interstellar travel to our restaurant situated at the end of time and matter.</p>

        <img src="images/towelstack.jpg" alt="A stack of towels.">
        <p>A towel. If you have ever used the Guide before, you will know that a towel is just about the most important 
            item one can carry. Especially if the need to hitchhike should arise.

        <p>Access to an Infinite Probability Drive. A wonderful method of crossing interstellar distances without having 
            to muck about in hyperspace.

        <p>Submit your reservation and settle your bill in retrospect. Once you've returned to your original time post meal, 
            simply request your completed reservation. Likewise, your bill for the meal can be paid by depositing a penny in 
            your present time: by the end of the universe, the compound interest will be enough to cover your meal.</p>
